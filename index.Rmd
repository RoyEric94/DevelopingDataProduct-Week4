## Analyzing and predicting flower species (Iris Dataset)

The iris dataset contains various information about four species of flowers. 

The information includes:

- The flower's sepal length
- The flower's sepal width
- The flower's petal length
- The flower's petal width

## Application summary

From this information, it is possible to build a prediction model to try and predict the species of flower based on new information.

This application does just that. The users selects two of the 4 available fields, then sets each value using sliders. 

## Feature plot of the Iris dataset

```{r iris}
  plot(iris, col = iris$Species)
```

## Model Example

In this example, the user chose the Sepal Length for the first feature, and the Petal Width for the second. Using the slider, the user selected a sepal length of 5.7 and a petal width of 1.3

```{r Running Code, echo=TRUE}
  
  # Build model formula
  modelFormula <- paste("Species ~ ", "Sepal.Length", 
                        "+", "Petal.Width")
  # Build model
  model <- train(formula(modelFormula), data=iris, method='lda', 
                 trControl=trainControl(method='cv', number=10))
  newData <- data.frame("xPredInput" = 5.7,"yPredInput" = 1.3)
  names(newData)[names(newData) == "xPredInput"] <- "Sepal.Length"
  names(newData)[names(newData) == "yPredInput"] <- "Petal.Width"
  modelPred <- predict(model, newData)
  paste("Predicted species:",as.character(modelPred))
```
